    "## 1. Getting Started with Anaconda\n",
    "----\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction to Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Anaconda?**\n",
    "Anaconda is a powerful distribution of Python and R designed specifically for scientific computing and data science. It comes packed with numerous libraries essential for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, making it an ideal choice for researchers and developers alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- **Anaconda Navigator:** A user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies the management of environments and packages.\n",
    "- **Conda:** A robust package manager that streamlines the installation and updating of libraries and their dependencies.\n",
    "- **Included Software:** Pre-installed with a wide array of popular data science tools, saving you time and effort in setting up your development environment.\n",
    "----\n",
    "### 1.2 Installation of Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downloading Anaconda\n",
    "* Visit the official Anaconda download page at [https://www.anaconda.com/download/success](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).\n",
    "* Select the installer that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Anaconda on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Installer**\n",
    "   - Locate the latest version for Windows and download the Graphical Installer (.exe file).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Installer**\n",
    "   - Double-click the downloaded .exe file to initiate the installation wizard.\n",
    "   - Follow the on-screen prompts.\n",
    "   - When asked, choose \"Just Me\" if this is a personal installation or \"All Users\" if you wish to make it available to everyone on the computer.\n",
    "   - Ensure the checkbox \"Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable\" is checked to facilitate easy access to Anaconda commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**\n",
    "   - Launch Anaconda Navigator from your Start menu and confirm it opens successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for pointing that out. You're correct; the installer for macOS is indeed a `.pkg` file, not a `.sh` script. Let's correct that section to reflect the accurate installation process for macOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Installing Anaconda on macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Installer**\n",
    "   - Select the latest version for macOS and download the Installer Package (.pkg file).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Installer**\n",
    "   - Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` file to start the installation process.\n",
    "   - Follow the on-screen prompts.\n",
    "   - Accept the license agreement.\n",
    "   - Use the default installation path unless you have a specific reason to change it.\n",
    "   - Choose to prepend Anaconda to your PATH in either your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file (for users of the Z shell).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**\n",
    "   - Find Anaconda Navigator in your Applications folder and verify it launches without issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Installing Anaconda on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the Installer**\n",
    "   - Pick the latest version for Linux and download the Shell Script Installer (.sh file).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Installer**\n",
    "   - Open Terminal.\n",
    "   - Change directory to where the .sh file is located.\n",
    "   - Make the installer executable:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     chmod +x Anaconda3-<version>-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Execute the installer:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ./Anaconda3-<version>-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Adhere to the on-screen instructions.\n",
    "   - Agree to the terms of use.\n",
    "   - Use the default installation directory unless otherwise needed.\n",
    "   - Decide whether to prepend Anaconda to your PATH in your shell configuration file (such as `.bashrc`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Installation**\n",
    "   - Restart your terminal session.\n",
    "   - Type `conda list` to display a list of installed packages.\n",
    "   - If installed correctly, Anaconda and Conda should appear in the list of packages.\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### Additional Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environment Variables:**\n",
    "  - On Windows, if you opted out of adding Anaconda to your PATH during installation, you can add it manually via System Properties.\n",
    "  - On macOS and Linux, ensure your shell profile includes the correct path to Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing Installation:**\n",
    "  - Open Anaconda Navigator and start Jupyter Notebook to ensure everything is functioning as expected.\n",

    "- Click the **Windows Menu** -> **Anaconda 3** -> **Jupyter Notebook**.\n",
    "- Open **Anaconda Navigator** and Click on “Launch” in the **Jupyter Notebook box**\n",
    "- Open **Anaconda Prompt** and Type “jupyter notebook” (without quotes) and hit the return key\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For macOS:\n",
    "- Open a terminal window (found in the **Utilities** folder).\n",
    "- Enter the command: `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "- Alternatively, to specify your preferred browser, use: `jupyter notebook --browser=firefox`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also launch Jupyter Notebook through **Anaconda Navigator**, located in your **Applications** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Linux:\n",
    "- Open a terminal.\n",
    "- Type: `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "- To choose a specific browser, enter: `jupyter notebook --browser=firefox`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Jupyter starts, your default web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter dashboard. To create a new notebook, click the **New** button located in the upper-right corner of the dashboard. Select **Python 3** or any other kernel you have installed. This action will open a new Jupyter Notebook where you can begin writing code and performing analyses.\n",

    "----\n",
    "### 3.1 Headings\n",
    "To create headings, you can use the `#` symbol followed by a space and your heading text. The number of `#` symbols denotes the level of the heading:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "# Heading 1\n",
    "## Heading 2\n",
    "### Heading 3\n",
